Hi everyone. This is going to be a demo of the progress for continuous vulnerability scanning for Container Registry. So I'm going to go to test project here and navigate over to security configuration. And if we have container scanning enabled, this option here will be toggleable. You see that's enabled here. You click on this, it's on. Click on this, it's off. Just to check that something is actually going on, we will see here the network request. We see that the mutation was fired and it is set to true. We turn it off, it is set to false. Again, to turn it back on, it's on. As far as the front-end communicating to the back-end, this piece is complete. If we go over to the vulnerability report, you will now see this new Container Registry vulnerabilities. This is feature flagged out because it is still in development. And if you click on this, this table that loads here is actually showing vulnerabilities that are shown currently under development vulnerabilities. The reason for that is that the back-end piece is still in progress and all we would have to do to make this work when the back-end is ready is update it to contain the updated type that is being introduced for Container Registry vulnerabilities. But it will otherwise show the table with the same columns for the initial iteration. What will change is most likely the description and identifier to reflect the type of vulnerabilities that are represented by Container Registry vulnerabilities. I'm going to navigate over to a different project. And if you go to security configuration, I wanted to demonstrate what this would look like if container scanning is not configured or not enabled in this case. You will still see the toggle, but you will see that you are not able to toggle it. It is grayed out and disabled. That way users still have the visibility into the feature. And if they want to know more, they can click on this link here which will navigate you to the documentation. So that's all we got for now. There is still ongoing work to introduce a banner on the vulnerability report which would go here. It is an alert style message and I can show that to you here. You go to which essentially would be this tab. Sorry, this alert window. That is in progress. And then what's remaining is also the status. This is all being done at the project level. Originally it was supposed to be done for project and group level, but we've held off on the group level because we don't have a group level security configuration page. And there are also open questions on how we would indicate this status at the group level. So there are intricacies there that are detailed out in a separate issue. That's all I got for now.
